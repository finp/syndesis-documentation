= Choose the finish connection

To add the finish connection to the integration:

. On the *Choose a Finish Connection* page, click *EBS Connect 1*. 
This integration finishes by using the credentials 
defined in *EBS Connect 1* to connect to an Oracle database. 

. On the *Choose an Action* page, click *Invoke SQL stored procedure*, 
which passes data to a stored procedure.

. Select the stored procedure that you want the connection to run.
The procedure you select determines the details for subsequent
steps in the integration, for example, which Salesforce fields
need to be mapped to which database fields.

For this sample integration, select `*CREATE_ORDER*`. 

. Click *Done* to add the finish connection to the integration.
