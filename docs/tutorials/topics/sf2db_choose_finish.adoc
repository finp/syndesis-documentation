= Choose the finish connection

To add the finish connection to the integration:

. On the *Choose a Finish Connection* page, click your
database connection. If you are using the sample database,
click the  *PostgresDB* connection. 
This integration finishes by using the credentials 
defined in the database connection to connect to an Oracle database. 

. On the *Choose an Action* page, click *Invoke SQL stored procedure*, 
which passes data to a stored procedure.

. In the *Procedure Name* field, click and select *add_lead*, which is the
provided stored procedure to run in the database. 
The selected procedure determines the requirements for 
steps in the integration, for example, which Salesforce fields
need to be mapped to which database fields. 

. Click *Done* to add the finish connection to the integration.
