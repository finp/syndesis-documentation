[[create-3api-integration]]
= Implement a sample integration of three APIs

This sample integration obtains data through an API, 
uses that data to obtain additional data through a second API 
and then uses the combined data to perform an action through 
a third API. 

Before you implement this integration, see <<prerequisites-3api>>. 

To implement the three-API sample integration, the main steps are:


. <<create-api1-connection>>. 
. <<create-api2-connection>>. 
. <<create-api3-connection>>.
. <<create-3api-integration>>.
. <<confirm-3api-works>>.
. <<clean-up-3api>>.
