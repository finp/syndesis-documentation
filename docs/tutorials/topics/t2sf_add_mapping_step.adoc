= Add a data mapping step

Add a data mapping step that correlates Twitter mention fields to 
Salesforce contact fields:

. In the left pane, hover over the plus sign between the filter
step and the finish connection to display a pop-up in which
you click *Add a Step*.
. Click *Data Mapping* and wait a few moments for the data fields
to appear.
. Map the Twitter `screenName` field to the Salesforce
`Title` field:
.. On the left, at the top of the list of source fields in Twitter, 
scroll down to see the *user* field. Expand it and scroll down to click 
the *screenName* field. (The ability to search directly for
*screenName* is expected to be available in a future release.)
.. On the right, at the top of the list of target fields in Salesforce,
click the magnifying 
glass image:images/magnifying-glass.png[title="Magnifying Glass"]
to display the search field and enter `*Title*`. 
.. Click the *Title* field. The data mapper displays a line 
from the Twitter source field to the Salesforce target field. 
. Map the Twitter `name` field to the Salesforce
`FirstName` and `LastName` fields:
.. In the *Sources* panel, under the *user* field, 
click the *name* field. 
.. On the right, in the *Mapping Details* panel, under *Action*, click 
the down caret and select *Separate*. 
.. In the *Target* search field, enter `*name*` and then click the
*FirstName* field. The data mapper displays a line to show the mapping. 
.. In the *Target* panel, click *LastName*. 
.. In the *Mapping Details* panel, under *Action*, click 
the down caret and select *Separate*. 
.. In the list of Twitter source fields, click *name* again. 
The data mapper displays another line from the Twitter
*name* field, but this time it goes to the Salesforce *LastName* field. 
The blue line indicates the current focus. 
. Map the Twitter `text` field to the Salesforce
`Description` field:
.. In the *Sources* search field, enter `*text*` and under 
*Status*, click the *text* field. 
.. In the *Target* search field, enter `*description*` and then click the
Salesforce *description* field to create the mapping. 
.. In the upper right, click 
the grid icon image:images/grid.png[title="Grid"] to
display the list of mappings, which should look like this:
