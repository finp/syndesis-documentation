= Create a Twitter connection

A {prodname} connection to Twitter requires registration of
{prodname} as an application that can access Twitter.
If you did not already register {prodname} as a
Twitter client, see <<register-with-twitter>>. 

To create a Twitter connection:

. In the left pane, click *Connections* to display available connections. 
Initially, there are no connections. 
. In the upper right, click *Create Connection* to display
{prodname} connection types. 
. Click the *Twitter* connection type. 
. Click *Connect Twitter* to display a Twitter authorization page. 
. Click *Authorize App* to return to {prodname}.
. In the *Connection Name* field, enter `*Twitter Connection 1*`.
. In the upper right, click *Create* to see that 
*Twitter Connection 1* is now an available connection. 

The next step is to <<create-sf-connection>>.
