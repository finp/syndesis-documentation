= Confirm that the Twitter to Salesforce integration works 

To confirm that the Twitter to Salesforce sample integration is working:

. In the left pane, click *Integrations* to see that the integration you
created is an *Active* integration,
which means that it is running. If you entered the example name, you
would see that *Twitter to Salesforce Sample* is running. 
. Confirm that the integration does not create a contact when a
tweet does not contain the text you specified in the basic filter 
step:
.. In Twitter, send a tweet that 
* Mentions your Twitter handle
* Does not contain the text you specified in the basic filter step
+
For example: `*@myTwitterName likes {prodname}*`
.. Wait for the polling interval to elapse, which can be 30 - 60 seconds. 
.. In Salesforce, confirm that a contact object with your Twitter
screen name does not exist. 
. Confirm that the integration creates a new contact when it should:
.. In Twitter, send a tweet that mentions your Twitter handle and
contains `*is great*` or whatever text
you specified in the basic filter text. 
For example, `*@Aslan thinks {prodname} is great.*`
.. Wait for the polling interval to elapse. 
.. In Salesforce, locate a contact object that has your Twitter screen name,
your first name, your last name and the text of your tweet in the
contact's `description` field. 
. Confirm that the integration updates a contact when it should:
.. In Twitter, send a different tweet. This tweet should also 
mention your Twitter handle and contain the text
you specified in the basic filter step. 
For example, `*@Aslan thinks open source is great.*`
.. Wait for the polling interval to elapse. 
.. In Salesforce, locate the contact object that has your Twitter 
screen name and confirm that the `description` field contains the 
text from the more recent tweet.
