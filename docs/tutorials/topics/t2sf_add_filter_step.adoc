= Add a basic filter step

Add a basic filter step that checks your tweets for particular content and 
continues the integration only if that content is present:

. In the left pane, hover over the plus sign between the start 
and finish connections to display a pop-up and then click *Add a step*. 
. Click *Basic Filter*. 
. In the first field, enter ``*text*`` to indicate that the content to
filter for is in the text of the tweet. 
. Accept *Contains* as the condition to be met for the integration to
continue. 
. In the last field, enter `*is great*` or some other text you choose. 
A tweet must contain the text you enter here for the integration to continue 
operating on this data.
. Click *Next* to complete the basic filter step.
