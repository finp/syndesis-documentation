= Add a basic filter step

Add a basic filter step that checks tweets that mention you 
for particular content. The integration
continues only if that content is present. 

To add a basic filter step:

. In the main pane, click *Add a step*. 
. Click *Basic Filter*. 
. In the first field, enter ``*text*`` to indicate that the content to
filter for is in the Twitter `text` field, which contains the text of the tweet. 
. Accept *contains* as the condition to be met for the integration to
continue. 
. In the last field, enter `*#RedHatIsGreat*` or some other text you choose. 
A tweet that mentions you must contain the text you enter here for 
the integration to continue operating on this data.
. Click *Next* to complete the basic filter step.
