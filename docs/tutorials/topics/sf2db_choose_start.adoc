= Choose the start connection

To choose the start connection:

. On the left, click *Integrations*. 
. In the upper right, click *Create Integration*. 
. On the *Choose a Start Connection* page, click *SF Connect 1*.
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click *On object Created*. 
. In the object name field, enter *Order*. 
. Click *Next*.

After connecting to Salesforce, the integration watches for 
notifications that a Salesforce *Order* 
object was created. 
When the integration finds such a notification, it passes the created
object's ID to the next step in the integration. 

However, before you can add the next step, you must choose the
integration's finish connection.
