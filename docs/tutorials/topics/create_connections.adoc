[[create-connections]]
= Create connections for {prodname} 

You create a {prodname} connection for each application that you want
to integrate. You must create a Twitter connection and a Salesforce
connection before you can create the Twitter to Salesforce sample integration. 
You must create a Salesforce connection and a stored procedure connection
before you can create the Salesforce to Oracle EBS sample integration. You need to
create only one Salesforce connection; you can use the same Salesforce
connection in both sample integrations.
