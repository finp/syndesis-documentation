= Implement a Twitter to Salesforce sample integration

:context: t2sf
This sample integration watches Twitter for tweets that mention
a particular Twitter user. When the integration finds such tweets, 
it filters
them so that only those tweets that contain the text you specify cause
the integration to continue. 

For tweets that contain the specified text, the integration passes
the Twitter data, including the Twitter user name, to Salesforce. 
Depending on whether that user name already exists as a Salesforce
contact, Salesforce either updates or creates a contact. 

To implement, deploy and test this sample integration, the main steps are:

. <<register-with-twitter>>.
. <<create-twitter-connection>>.
. <<register-with-salesforce-{context}>>.
. <<create-salesforce-connection-{context}>>.
. <<create-twitter-sf-integration>>.
. <<t2sf-confirm-works>>.
. <<t2sf-clean-up>>.

Before you implement this sample integration, 
see <<t2sf-prerequisites>>.
