= Clean up your integration

In this Technology Preview release, exactly one integration at 
a time can be running. You can create another sample integration, 
but you cannot publish it while an integration is running. 

When you are done working with a sample integration, deactivate it:

. In the left panel, click *Integrations*.
. In the main panel, click the entry for the sample integration 
you want to deactivate. 
. In the integration summary, click *Stop Integration* and click 
*OK* to confirm that you want to stop running the integration.

When there is a deactivated sample integration, 
you can run another sample integration. 

When you are no longer working with a sample integration you 
should delete it. Ensure that the sample integration is 
`Inactive` and then at the bottom of the summary, click 
*Delete Integration* and *OK* to confirm.
