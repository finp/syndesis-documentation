= Choose the start connection

To choose the start connection:

. On the left, click *Integrations*. 
. In the upper right, click *Create Integration*. 
. On the *Choose a Start Connection* page, click *Twitter Connection 1*.
When the integration starts it uses the credentials defined in 
*Twitter Connection 1* to connect to Twitter.
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click *Twitter Mention*. 

After 
connecting to Twitter, the integration monitors Twitter for mentions
that include your Twitter screen name. A match triggers the
first step in the integration. However, before you add steps to the integration,
you choose the connection that the integration uses to finish its work.
