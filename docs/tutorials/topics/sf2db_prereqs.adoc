= Prerequisites for implementing salesforce to database integration

To implement a Salesforce to Oracle database sample integration:

* In your GitHub account, you must have registered and authorized 
{prodname}. If you did not already do this, visit 
https://developer.github.com/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/registering-oauth-apps/[Registering OAuth Apps].
Save the client ID and client secret in an easily accessible place or
keep the registered app tab open to easily obtain those values. 

* A Salesforce account that is used for development and that contains
dummy data

* A way to trigger an event that starts this integration. 
 
* A Postgresql (and internally Oracle) database that you can experiment in or
the Red Hat provided database available by .....TBA.
