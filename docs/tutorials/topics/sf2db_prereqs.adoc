= Prerequisites for implementing Salesforce to Oracle EBS integration

To implement a Salesforce to Oracle EBS sample integration:

* You need an account in a Salesforce installation that is used for development. 
This account must have Salesforce API access, which is available in a 
Salesforce Enterprise account or a Salesforce Developer account. To obtain
a free developer account, visit https://developer.salesforce.com/signup. 
 
* You need a PostgreSQL (and internally Oracle) database that you can experiment
in or the sample database available for use with {prodname}. Your 
installation of {prodname} provides the `PostgresDB` connection,
which you use to connect to the sample database.
