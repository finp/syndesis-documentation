[[Choose-Finish-Connection]]
= Choose the Finish Connection

To add the finish connection to the integration:

. On the *Choose a Finish Connection* page, click *Salesforce Connection 1*. 
This integration finishes by using the credentials 
defined in *Salesforce Connection 1* to 
connect to Salesforce. 
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click *Create/Update Salesforce object*.
. On the next page, accept *Contact* as the
Salesforce object to create or update and click *Next*.
. On the next page, enter `*TwitterScreenName_c*` as the field
that holds the identifying value. The
connection uses the value in this custom field to determine 
whether creation of
a Salesforce contact is required. If a Salesforce contact
with this ID already exists then the integration updates that contact. 
Otherwise, the integration creates a contact.
. Click *Done* to add the finish connection to the integration.
