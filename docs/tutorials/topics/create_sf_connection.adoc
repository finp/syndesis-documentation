= Create a Salesforce connection

A {prodname} connection to Salesforce requires registration of
{prodname} as an application that can access Salesforce.
If you did not already register {prodname}, see <<register-with-sf>>. 

After you create a Salesforce connection, you can use it
in both sample applications.

To create a Salesforce connection:

. In the left pane, click *Connections* to display available connections. 
. In the upper right, click *Create Connection* to display
{prodname} connection types. 
. Click the *Salesforce* connection type. 
. Click *Connect Salesforce* to display a Salesforce authorization page. 
. Click *Authorize App* to return to {prodname}.
. In the *Connection Name* field, enter `*SF Connect 1*`.
In the *Description* field, enter `*Sample Salesforce connection
that uses my Salesforce log-in credentials.*`
. In the upper right, click *Create* to see that 
*SF Connect 1* is now an available connection.
