= Add a second Salesforce connection

The Salesforce connection that starts the integration watches for 
notifications that indicate that a Salesforce *Order* object
was created. 
The second Salesforce connection obtains the newly-created *Order* object.

To add a second Salesforce connection:

. In the left pane, hover over the plus sign to display a pop-up in
which you click *Add a Connection*.
. Click *SF Connect 1* as the connection type to add.
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click *Get Object*.
. On the next page, select *Order* as the
Salesforce object to fetch. 
. Click *Done* to add this connection to the integration.
