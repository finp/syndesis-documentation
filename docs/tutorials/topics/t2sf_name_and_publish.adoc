= Give the integration a name and deploy it

The sample integration is complete. To deploy it:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
. At the top of the left panel, in the *Integration Name* field, 
enter a name of your choice that distinguishes this integration
from any other integration. For 
example: `*Twitter to Salesforce Sample Integration*`.
. In the upper right corner, click *Publish*. 

{prodname} starts to deploy your integration immediately. 
Deployment takes a few moments.
