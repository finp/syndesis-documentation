= Register {prodname} as a Salesforce client

You must register your installation of {prodname} as an application 
that can access Salesforce. 
This lets you create any number of integrations that connect
to Salesforce. In other words, you need to register {prodname}
with Salesforce only once. 

ifeval::["{context}" == "t2sf"]
If you already registered Salesforce as a {prodname}
client and created a Salesforce connection, skip to <<create-twitter-sf-integration>>.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{context}" == "sf2db"]
If you already registered Salesforce as a {prodname}
client and created a Salesforce connection, skip to  <<create-sf-db-integration>>.
endif::[]


Perform these steps to register {prodname} as a Salesforce client:

. In {prodname}, in the left pane, click *Home*.
. Copy the {prodname} URL from the browser address bar.
. In {prodname}, in the left pane, click *Settings*.
. In the *OAuth Application Management* page, to the left of *Salesforce*,
click *>* to display the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* fields.
. In another browser tab, log in to your Salesforce account and 
follow the steps below to create a connected app. 
These instructions assume that you are
using the Salesforce Lightning Experience user interface. To switch from the 
Salesforce Classic interface, click your profile icon and select
*Switch to Lightning Experience*. 
For additional information, see the Salesforce documentation for 
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=connected_app_create.htm[Create a Connected App]. 
.. In Salesforce, in the upper right, click the settings icon 
image:images/salesforce-settings-icon.png[title="Settings"] and then in 
the left pane expand *Apps* and click *App Manager*.
.. In the upper right, click *New Connected App*. 
.. Enter the required information and select *Enable OAuth Settings*.
.. In the *Callback URL* field, paste your 
{prodname} URL, which you copied in step 2.
Remove `dashboard` from the end of the URL
and append `api/v1/credentials/callback`. For example: 
`https://app-proj9128.7b63.{prodnameinurl}.openshiftapps.com/api/v1/credentials/callback`.
.. For *OAuth Scopes*, add:
** *Access and manage your data*
** *Allow access to your unique identifier*
** *Perform requests on your behalf at any time*       
.. Select *Include ID token* and then *Include Standard Claims*. 
.. After you save the connected app, copy the consumer 
key that the *New Connected App* wizard provides. 
. Return to your {prodname} installation *Settings* page and paste the 
Salesforce-provided
consumer key into the Salesforce *Client ID* field. 
. Back in Salesforce, copy the consumer secret that the 
*New Connected App* wizard provides. 
. Return to your {prodname} installation *Settings* page and paste the 
Salesforce-provided
consumer secret into the Salesforce 
*Client Secret* field. 
. Click *Save* and then click *Ok*.
