= Confirm that the Salesforce to Oracle EBS integration works

To confirm that the Salesforce to Oracle EBS integration is working:

. In the left pane, click *Integrations* to see that your sample
integration is an *Active* integration,
which means that it is running. If you used the example name, you would 
see that 
*Salesforce to Oracle EBS Sample Integration* is *Active*.

. In your Salesforce installation, create a new lead. 

. In the database that the integration connects to, check for the
new lead.
