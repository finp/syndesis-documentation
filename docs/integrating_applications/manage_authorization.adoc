=== Managing Connection Authorizations

{prodname} obtains authorization for {prodname}
to access the applications you want to connect to in an integration. 

While each connection is associated with one {prodname} user, 
authorization applies to all {prodname} connections to a given application.
This means that there is one client ID and one client secret for 
authorization that lets {prodname} access one application. For example, 
all {prodname} connections to Twitter use the same client ID and the
same client secret.
