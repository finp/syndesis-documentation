= Importing integrations

When you import an integration, {prodname} always sets the status of 
the imported integration as *Draft*. Since a {prodname} allows only one 
draft integraion, what happens if you already have a draft integration?

To import an integration:

. Open the {prodname} environment that you want to import the integration into. 
. In the left pane, click *Integrations*. 
. In the upper right, click *Import*. 
. Drag and drop the exported integration zip file that you want to import, 
or navigate to the zip file and select it. 
. After {prodname} uploads the file, click *Import*. {prodname} displays
information about connections that require configuration in this
{prodname} environment. 
. Add configuration details to each connection that requires it.
