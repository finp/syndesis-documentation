= Add a database connection to an integration

You must create a database connection before you can add it to an
integration. If you did not already create the database connection, 
see <<create-database-connection>>. 

== Database connections as start connections

In an integration, to add a database connection as the integration's
start connection:  

. In the {prodname} pane on the left, click *Integrations*. 
. Click *Create Integration*. 
. On the *Choose a Start Connection* page, click your 
database connection. 
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click one of the following:
+
* *Periodic SQL Invocation* obtains data by periodically invoking the
SQL query you specify.
* *Periodic Stored Procedure* obtains data by periodically invoking
the stored procedure you specify or select. 
. If you selected *Periodic SQL Invocation*, in the *Query* field,
enter a SQL `SELECT` command to obtain the data of interest.
+
If you selected *Periodic Stored Procedure*, in the
*Stored Procedure* field, select or enter the stored procedure to 
invoke to obtain the data of interest.
. In the *Period* field, enter an integer and indicate whether the unit is
minutes, hours or days. For example, if you indicate 5 minutes then
the connection invokes the specified query or stored procedure every
five minutes. 
. Click *Done*. {prodname} tries to validate the connection, which includes
checking that a specified SQL query is syntactically correct and
confirming that the query or stored procedure target data exists. If
verfication is successful then {prodname} adds the start connection to
the integration. If verification fails then {prodname} displays a message
about the problem. Update your input as needed and try again. 

== Database connections as middle or finish connections

In an integration, you can designate a database connection as the 
finish connection or add a database connection between the start and
finish connections. The instructions below assume that you are 
on the {prodname} *Choose a Finish Connection* page or the
*Choose a Connection* page.

To add a database connection:

. Click your database connection. 
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click one of the following:
+
* *Invoke SQL* operates on data by executing the
SQL query you specify.
* *Invoke Stored Procedure* operates on data by invoking
the stored procedure you specify or select. 
. If you selected *Invoke SQL*, in the *SQL Statement* field,
enter a SQL `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` command to 
operate on the data of interest.
+
If you selected *Invoke Stored Procedure*, in the
*Stored Procedure* field, select or enter the stored procedure to 
invoke to operate on the data of interest.
. Click *Done*. {prodname} tries to validate the connection, which includes
checking that a specified SQL query is syntactically correct and
confirming that the query or stored procedure target data exists. If
verfication is successful then {prodname} adds the connection to
the integration. If verification fails then {prodname} displays a message
about the problem. Update your input as needed and try again.
