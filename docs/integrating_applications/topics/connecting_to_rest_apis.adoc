= Connecting to REST APIs

In an integration, to connect to a REST API, you must have created a
connector for that API by uploading a Swagger specification that 
describes the API. See <<creating-api-connectors>>. 

To create a connection to a REST API: 

. In {prodname}, in the left pane, click *Connections* to 
display any available connections. 
. In the upper right, click *Create Connection* to display 
available connectors.   
. Click the the connector for the API you want to create a connection for.  
. In the *Endpoint URL* field, enter the API location you want the 
connection to use and click *Next*.
. In the *Connection Name* field, enter your choice of a name that
helps you distinguish this connection from any other connection. 
. In the *Description* field, optionally enter any information that
is helpful to know about this connection. 
. In the upper right, click *Create* to see that the connection you 
created is now available.
