= Workflow for creating an integration



After you log in to the {prodname} console, the general steps 
for integrating applications are:

. Register {prodname} for access to the applications you want to integrate.
. For each application you want to integrate, create a connection.
. Create the integration:
.. Select the start connection. This connection starts the integration by
accessing the application you want to obtain data from. 
.. Select the action you want the start connection to perform. 
.. Optionally, depending on the connection, enter some 
configuration information, such as login credentials.
.. Select the finish connection. This connection completes the
integration by accessing the 
application that uses the data from the start connection. 
.. Select the action you want the finish connection to perform.
.. Optionally, depending on the connection, enter some configuration
details. 
.. Optionally, between the start connection and the finish connection, 
add one or more connections to other applications. 
.. Optionally, between connections, pperate on the data by adding one or 
more steps. Possible steps include filtering and mapping data.

. Publish your integration to run it.
