= Workflow for creating an integration



After you log in to the {prodname} console, the general steps 
for integrating applications are:

. Register {prodname} for access to the applications you want to integrate.
. For each application you want to integrate, create a connection.
. Click *Create Integration*.
. Select a source connection. This connection accesses the application
you want to obtain data from. 
. Select the action you want the source connection to
perform. 
. Optionally, depending on the connection, enter some 
configuration information, such as login credentials.
. Select a destination connection. This connection accesses the 
application that uses the data from the source connection. 
. Select the action you want the destination connection to perform.
. Optionally, depending on the connection, enter some configuration
details. 
. Optionally, add one or more steps to be performed between the 
source application and the destination application. Possible steps
include logging, filtering data, splitting data, mapping data, and 
more. 
. Optionally, add a connection for an application you want to access
after you obtain data from the source application and before
you send data to the destination application. 
. Publish your integration to run it.
