= How you use {prodname} 

The best way to learn about how to use {prodname} is to create the sample
integrations by following the instructions in the
https://access.qa.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_fuse/7.0-tp/html-single/fuse_ignite_sample_integration_tutorial[sample integration tutorials].

One of the sample integrations captures updates in Salesforce and
calls a database stored procedure to synchronize the database with the
Salesforce updates. The main steps for doing this are:

. Register your installation of {prodname} as an application that can access
Salesforce. You need to do this only once to be able to create any number of 
integrations that connect to Salesforce. 

. Create a Salesforce connection. To configure this connection, you follow
prompts for logging in to the desired Salesforce account. You can use 
the same Salesforce connection in any number of integrations. 

. Choose your Salesforce connection as the connection that starts the
integration. 

. Choose the action that you want the Salesforce connection to perform. In 
the sample integration, you choose the *On create* action for the
*Lead* object. After connecting to Salesforce, the integration watches for
notifications that a Salesforce lead was created. When the integration
finds such a notification, it passes the new lead's data to the next
step in the integration. However, before you can add the next step, you
must choose the integration's finish connection. 

. Choose the *PostgresDB* connection as the connection that completes
the integration. 

. Choose the action that you want the *PostgresDB* connection to perform. 
In the sample integration, you choose *add_lead* as the procedure
you want to invoke. This is a provided stored procedure that runs in 
the sample database. This procedure determines the requirements
for which Salesforce fields need to be mapped to which database fields. 

. Add a step between the Salesforce connection and the database connection. 
This step maps Salesforce fields to database fields. 

. Give the integration a name. Optionally, enter a description of what
the integration does. 

. Click *Publish* to start running the integration. 

. On the {prodname} dashboard, confirm that the Salesforce to database 
integration is designated as *Active*, which means that it is running.

. Confirm that the integratiosn is working as expected by creating a new
lead in Salesforce. 

. For this sample integration, in a browser, insert `todo-` in 
front of the URL for your {prodname} installation. This displays the 
notification that a new lead was created.
