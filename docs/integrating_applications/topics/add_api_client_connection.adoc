= Add an API client connection to an integration

Before you can add an API connection to an integration, you must
create a connection to that API. See <<create-rest-api-connection>>. 

In this release, in an integration, a connection to an API can be
the finish connection or a middle connection. It cannot be the
start connection. The instructions below
assume that {prodname} is prompting you to select a finish connection
or a connection that is not the start connection.

To add an API connection to an integraton:

. On the page that displays available connections, click the API 
connection you want to add to the integration. 
. Click the action that you want the connection to perform. 
The actions that are available are based on the resource operations 
specified in the Swagger file uploaded to {prodname} that describes the API
you are connecting to. 
. Depending on the action you select, enter any parameters that 
{prodname} prompts for. 
. Click *Done*.
