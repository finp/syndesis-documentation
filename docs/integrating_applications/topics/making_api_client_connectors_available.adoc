= Making API client connectors available

TBA

When creating a new API connector, I need the ability to import an existing Swagger definition from my local file system or a remote URL. When importing a Swagger definition, 
I expect Syndesis to verify that the document is valid and supplies all information required to create an API connector. If the document is invalid or does not supply required 
information, Syndesis should provide me with a warning with details and not allow an API connector to be created. In the event that the API definition does not declare request 
or response types, the definition should not be considered invalid and any resource operations missing type information should result in typeless actions in the connector.
