= Planning integrations

Before you create an integration, it is assumed that you have done
some planning so that you have answers to the following questions.

To start the integration:

* Which application should the integration obtain data from?
* In that application, what triggers the action that obtains the data?
For example, an integration that starts by obtaining data from 
Twitter might trigger on a Twitter mention. 
* What are the data fields of interest?
* What credentials does the integration use to access this application?

To end the integration:

* Which application receives the data?
* In that application, what action does the integration perform?
* What are the data fields of interest?
* What credentials does the integration use to access this application?

In between the start and end applications:

* Do you need to connect to any other applications? For any other
applications the integration connects to:
+
** What action should the integration perform?
** What are the data fields of interest?
** What credentials should the integration use?

* Between connections, does the integration need to operate on the data?
For example:
+
** Should the integration filter the data it operates on?
** Do field names differ between source and target applications? If they
do then data mapping is required.
** Does the integration need to operate on the data in some customized way?
