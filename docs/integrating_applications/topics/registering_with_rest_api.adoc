= Register {prodname} as an API client

Custom API client connectors might require {prodname} to obtain
authorization to access the API. The Swagger specification from which 
{prodname} created the API connector should specify any such
security requirements. 

To register {prodname} as an authorized API client:

. In {prodname}, in the left pane, click *Settings*. 
. TBA - how do you add an entry for a connection to an API?
. TBA - how do you obtain values for client ID and client secret from
the API?
