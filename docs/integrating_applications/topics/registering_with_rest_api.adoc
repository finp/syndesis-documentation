= Register {prodname} as an API client

Before {prodname} creates an API client
connector, it prompts you to indicate the API's security requirements.
For APIs that use OAuth, when {prodname} creates the connector it also 
adds an entry for the API to the {prodname} *Settings* page. This is
where you provide the API client ID and the API client secret that
authorize {prodname} to access the API. 

If the API you want to connect to does not use OAuth, skip this 
section and see <<create-rest-api-connection>>.  

To register {prodname} as an authorized API client:

. Prepare the {prodname} callback URL that the API will use:
.. In {prodname}, in the left pane, click *Home*.
.. Copy the {prodname} URL from the browser address bar and paste it in 
a text file. 
.. In the text file, remove `dashboard` from the end of the URL.
.. Append `api/v1/credentials/callback`. For example, your callback URL
might look like this:
`\https://app-proj9128.7b63.{prodnameinurl}.openshiftapps.com/api/v1/credentials/callback`.
. In {prodname}, in the left pane, click *Settings*. 
. Look for the name of the API you want to connect to and click its 
*Register* button to display its client ID and client secret fields. 
. In another browser window, go the authorization URL for the API you
want to connect to. 
. Follow the prompts there to obtain the API client ID and API client secret
that {prodname} will use to access the API.  
. Paste the API client ID and the API client secret into their
respective fields in the {prodname} *Settings* page. 
. Click *Save*.
