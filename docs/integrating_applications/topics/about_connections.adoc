= About {prodname} connections

A connection represents a specific application that you want to obtain data from
or send data to. For example, the set of connections you can choose from might  
include a Twitter connection, a Salesforce connection, a Gmail connection, and so on. 
Each connection has been created and configured by someone in your organization.

In any number of integrations, you can select the same connection. For example,
in integration A you can select a Twitter connection and configure it to 
use `JDoe` as the Twitter screen name. In
integration B, you can select that same Twitter connection and configure it
to use `KLee` as the Twitter screen name. When multiple integrations
use the same connection, and there is an update to that connection,
{prodname} automatically updates all integrations that use 
that connection.
