= About copying integrations

Each {prodname} installation is an environment from which you 
can export an integration. Exporting an integration downloads a zip file 
that contains the information needed to recreate the integration in a 
different {prodname} environment. 

In an environment, each integration can have only one *Draft* version.

The result of importing an integration depends on whether an integration with
the same name is already present. The following table describes the various
possibilities.

|In the importing environment:
|After importing the integration:

|No integration has the same name as the integration being imported.
|The integration is in the *Draft* state. The import operation creates each 
connection that the imported integration uses and copies all connection 
settings except for secrets. You must edit each connection that is incomplete 
and ensure that it is configured for its new environment. 

|There is a published or deactivated integration with the same name as the 
integration being imported.
|The integration is updated. Connection settings are not updated.

If the imported integration does not contain any new connections that
require configuration then the integration is ready to be published. 

If the integration has new connections that require configuration then the
imported integration is in the *Draft* state. You must add required
configuration to any new connections. 

|There is only a draft integration with the same name as the integration being 
imported.
|The imported integration is now the *Draft* and the previous draft is lost.
