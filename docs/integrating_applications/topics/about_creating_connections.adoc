= About creating connections

To create a connection, you 
select a connector and respond to prompts to configure the connection. 
The configuration details you need to provide vary for each application. 
After configuring the connection, you give it a name that helps you 
distinguish it from any other connections to the same application. 
Optionally, you can specify a description of the connection.

You can use the same connector to create any number of connections to that
application. For example, you can use the Salesforce connector to create
three different connections. Each connection to Salesforce can specify a 
different user's Salesforce log-in credentials.
