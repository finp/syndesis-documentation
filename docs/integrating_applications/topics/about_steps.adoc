= About steps

In some integrations, obtaining data from one application and 
using it in another application is all you want to do. But in other
integrations, you might need one or more steps between the data's
source and target applications. A step can be an interaction with 
another application or service or it can be an operation on the
data. Operations are based on the Enterprise Integration 
Patterns, for example, steps can filter,
split, map or log data.
