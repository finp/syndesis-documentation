= About steps

In some integrations, obtaining data from one application and 
using it in another application is all you want to do. But in other
integrations, you might want to operate on data after obtaining it from
one application and before sending it to another application. 
To operate on data, you add a step. {prodname} provides steps for:

* Filtering data so that the integration continues only when it meets 
criteria you define. 
 
* Mapping data fields in one application to data fields in another
application. 

* Describing the data type for requests and responses when connecting
to a REST API. 

For details, see <<add-steps>>.
