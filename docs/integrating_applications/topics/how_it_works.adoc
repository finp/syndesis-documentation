= How {prodname} works

{prodname} lets you enable data transfer between different applications. For example,
each time a customer is mentioned in Twitter, you might want to capture that
mention in your Salesforce account for that customer. Another example is a service 
that makes stock trade recommendations. You can capture recommendations of interest
and forward them to a service that automates stock transfers. 

{prodname} provides a web browser interface that lets your integrate 
two different applications or services without writing code. It also provides 
features that allow you to introduce code if it is needed for complex 
use cases. 

To create and run a simple integration, 
the main steps are:

. Create a connection to each application that you want to integrate.
. Select the start connection. This connection is to the application that 
contains the data you want to share with another application. 
. Select the finish connection. This connection is to the application 
that receives data from the start connection and that completes the
integration. 
. Map data fields from the start connection to data fields in the 
finish connection. 
. Give the integration a name.
. Click *Publish* to start running the integration.  

The {prodname} dashboard lets you monitor and manage integrations. You can 
see which integrations are running, start and stop integrations, edit and 
deactivate integrations.

The {prodname} *Create Connection* page lets you create a connection by
selecting
the connector for the application or service you want to connect to. 
{prodname} prompts you to enter values for the parameters required to create 
the connection.
