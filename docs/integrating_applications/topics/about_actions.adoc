= About actions

In an integration, each connection performs an action. For some
connections, you choose the action. Other connections can perform
only one action and you are not offered a choice when you create
an integration that uses that connection. For example, when you create
an integration that uses a Salesforce connection the possible
actions include creating a Salesforce account, updating a Salesforce
account, searching Salesforce, and more. 

Some actions require additional configuration and {prodname}
prompts you for this information if it is needed.
