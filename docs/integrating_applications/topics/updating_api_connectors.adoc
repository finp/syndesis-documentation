= Updating API connectors

You cannot update an API connector. If there is
an update to the API's Swagger specification, then you must upload an updated
Swagger file and create a new API connector. 

To update integrations to use connections based on the updated Swagger
specification:

. Create a new API connector based on the updated Swagger specification. 
. Create a new connection from the new connector.
. Edit the integration to remove the old connection and add the new connection.
. Republish the integration.
