= Adding a Twitter connection to an integration

Add intro. 

To add a Twitter connection to an integration:

. Click the Twitter connection
you created. If you gave it the example name, you would 
click *Twitter Connect 1*.
When the integration starts it uses the credentials defined in 
this connection to connect to Twitter.
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click *Mention*. 

After 
connecting to Twitter, the integration monitors Twitter for mentions
that include your Twitter screen name. A match triggers the
first step in the integration. However, before you add steps to the integration,
you choose the connection that the integration uses to finish its work.
