= About integrations

To set up data integration between applications, you create an integration. 
An integration includes:

* A connection to the application that is the
source of the data. 

* A connection to the application that receives the data. 

* Optional additional connections between the start and finish
connections. An additional connection can obtain other data. 

* Optional steps that operate on data between connections. Typically,
there is a step that maps data fields from the source connection to the
target connection.
