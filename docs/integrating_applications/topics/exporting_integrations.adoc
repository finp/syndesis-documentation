You can export an integration whose status is one of the following:

* *Draft*

* *Deactivated*

To export an integration:

. In the left pane of {prodname}, click *Integrations*. 
. In the list of integrations, click the entry for the integration 
that you want to export.
. In the integration's summary page, in the upper right, click *Export*.

the integration into another {prodname} environment, open that environment
and import this zip file.
