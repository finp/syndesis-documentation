= Managing integrations

TBA - Just some notes:
Monitoring running integrating_applications
Evaluating log information to manage and troubleshoot integrating_applications
Updating integrations
Managing versions of integrations across development, test and 
production environments

The history page for an integration lists all the version of that integration
that have been published. If you have a problem with the active integration,
you can re-deploy an older integration from this page. 

Published = active and running

For a given integration:
* There is only ever one draft.
* There is only ever one active integration

See the following topics:
