= About API client connectors

{prodname} can create connectors for REST APIs 
(representational state transfer application programming interfaces) 
that support Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)/1.0 or HTTP/1.1.
To do this, {prodname} requires a valid
Swagger 2.0 specification that describes a REST API you want to connect to. 
If the API service provider does not make a Swagger specification available
then you must create the Swagger specification.
 
After you upload a Swagger specification to {prodname}, a connector to the API
becomes available. An integrator can select the connector, create
an API client connection and then add that connection to an integration. 

When {prodname} creates an API client connector, it maps each resource
operation in the Swagger specification to an action. The name
of the action is a combination of the resource path and the HTTP verb.
The action description comes from the corresponding documentation if 
it is available in the Swagger specification. 

The more detail that the Swagger specification provides the more support
{prodname} can offer when connecting to the API. For example, 
the API definition is not required to declare data types for input to 
operations or output from operations. Without type declarations, {prodname}
defines the corresponding connection action as typeless. However, in an
integration, you cannot add a data mapping step immediately before or 
immediately after an API connection that performs a typeless action. 

One remedy for this is to add more information to the Swagger specification
before you upload it to {prodname}. Identify the Swagger resource operations that
will map to the actions you want the API connection to perform. In the
Swagger specification, ensure that there is a JSON schema that specifies
each operation's input and output types.

{prodname} connectors support OAuth 1.0 and 2.0 and HTTP Basic
Authorization. If access to the API requires Transport Layer Security (TLS)
then the API needs to use a valid certificate that is issued by
a recognized Certificate Authority (CA).

{prodname} cannot create connectors for APIs that support the HTTP 2.0
protocol. 

See <<creating-api-connectors>> for instructions for
uploading a Swagger specification.
